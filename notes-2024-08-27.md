## Administrative Stuff

We encourage you to ask questions via the general Slack channel: [`#2024-coe322-general`](https://join.slack.com/t/tacc-learn/shared_invite/zt-2p8bpr3gw-d2MpUDfYP1vjm6nQj7GM7g).

Please complete the following administrative tasks prior to next class meeting:

1. As outlined in the [welcome letter](https://utexas.instructure.com/courses/1396207/discussion_topics/5049775), create: 

	1. a TACC portal account
	2. a private GitHub repository
	3. invite the instructors and TA to your private repo: `VictorEijkhout`, `susanunit` and `trido2`

1. Email the instructors (eijkhout@tacc.utexas.edu, slindsey@tacc.utexas) the following information:

	1. Your name
	1. UT EID
	1. TACC portal username
	1. GitHub username

After we receive this information, we will add you to the class allocation. This process may take a day or two and then you will be able to log into the class machine.  

<!-- 1. Log on to the class machine: `isp.tacc.utexas.edu`

	**Windows Users**: You'll need to download a terminal/shell program to make use of the command-line.  We recommend either [PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows?view=powershell-7.3) or [Putty](https://www.putty.org/).  See: [SSH Using Windows](https://github.com/TACC/coe322fall2023/blob/main/tutorials/SSH%20Using%20Windows%202.pdf)  -->
	

## Homework 1 

Homework 1 is due next Tuesday, September 3, 11:59pm.  

**Research your favorite person, anecdote and/or fact in the history of computer programming.  Write up one or two pages and save the document in PDF format. Upload this document to your personal repository by the due date.**

This is a single-person homework. You may not work in groups.  Each student must submit their own write-up.

### Steps

1. Create your write up on your laptop/tablet and save/export as a PDF file, i.e. `mywriteup.pdf`.
1. Create a folder, `hw1`, in your private repo and put your file there.
1. Push/upload this new file to your personal repository.  (We'll go over `git` commands in class on Thursday)

	<pre>
	localhost$ <b>git add mywriteup.pdf</b>
	localhost$ <b>git push</b></pre>
