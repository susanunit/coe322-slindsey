Today in Class September 12, 2024 & HW4

Today in class & HW4:

* Started with a brief introduction to `cmake`, a build system, with a simple example using a single source file.  See the first few slides of the `cmake.pdf` slide deck in the [`/tutorials`](https://github.com/TACC/coe322fall2024/tree/main/tutorials) subdirectory.
* Continued with [Lambda Functions](https://github.com/TACC/coe322fall2024/blob/main/lectures/6%20Lambda%20functions.pdf), introducing Captures.  
* We worked on Homework 4 in class. 

## NEW Homework 4

**Homework 4 is Exercises 4 & 5 in the Lambda Functions slide deck plus a `Cmakelists.txt` that successfully builds the executable/binary. 
Homework 4 is due by Wednesday, September 18, 11:59pm.**

Place both your source code and `CMakeLists.txt` file in a subdirectory of your personal repository named `hw4`.

## Homework Instructions

Homeworks will be due on Mondays and/or Wednesdays at midnight.  Automatic scripts will collect your homework from the appropriate subdirectory in your private GitHub repository.  It is your responsibility to ensure the instructors and the TA have access to this repository.

* **Put your name, UTEID, and TACC username at the top of each source code file.** 
* Your code must compile and execute without errors on the ISP machine using the `icpx` compiler.  
* Comment your code.
* Do NOT upload executable files to your personal repo, e.g. "`a.out`".
