Today in Class September 10, 2024

Today in class:

* Continued with the Newton root-finding Exercise 1 in the [Functions](https://github.com/TACC/coe322fall2024/blob/main/lectures/5%20Functions.pdf) slide deck.  See a solution, `newton.cpp`,  in the [`skeletons`](https://github.com/TACC/coe322fall2024/tree/main/skeletons) subdirectory of the class respository.
* Began a new topic, [Lamda Functions](https://github.com/TACC/coe322fall2024/blob/main/lectures/6%20Lambda%20functions.pdf) and covered all the material up to Captures, which we'll cover on Thursday.  We did Exercises 1 and 2 from this slide deck in class.  See the [`newton-lambda.cpp`](https://github.com/TACC/coe322fall2024/blob/main/skeletons/newton-lambda.cpp) solution in the class repo.  (**Emacs users**: see the emacs tips demonstrated in class today commented out at the bottom of this file.)
