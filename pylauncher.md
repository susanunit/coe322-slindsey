## What is PyLauncher		{ #intro }

PyLauncher (**Py**thon + **Launcher**) is a Python-based parametric job launcher, a utility for distributing and executing many small jobs in parallel, using fewer resources than would be necessary to execute all jobs simultaneously. On many batch-based cluster computers this is a better strategy than submitting many small individual small jobs.

While TACC's deprecated Launcher utility worked on serial codes, PyLauncher works with multi-threaded and MPI executables.  

**Example**: You need to run a program with 1000 different input values, and you want to use 100 cores for that; PyLauncher will then cycle through your list of commands using cores as they become available. 

The PyLauncher source code is written in Python, but this need not concern you: in the simplest scenario you use a two line Python script. However, for more sophisticated scenarios the code can be extended or integrated into a Python application.

## Installations		{ #installations }

PyLauncher is available on all TACC systems via the [Lmod modules system][TACCLMOD].  Use the following in your batch script or [`idev`][TACCIDEV] session.

```cmd-line
$ module load pylauncher
```

!!! important 
	On some systems the Python installation is missing a required module. 
	Do a one-time setup:   

	`$ pip install paramiko`


## Basic setup { #setup }

PyLauncher, like any compute-intensive application, must be invoked from a Slurm job script, or interactively within an `idev` session. PyLauncher interrogates Slurm's environment variables to query the available computational resources, but the only parameter you have to set is

```job-script
#SBATCH -N 5 # number of nodes you want to use
```

Pylauncher will then use all the cores of these nodes, running by default one commandline per core. See below for exceptions.

The number of nodes depends on how much work you have.

Load the pylauncher module to set the `TACC_PYLAUNCHER_DIR` and `PYTHONPATH` environment variables. 

```cmd-line
c123-456$ module load pylauncher
```

Your batch script can then invoke Python3 on the launcher code:

```file
## file: mylauncher.py
import pylauncher 
pylauncher.ClassicLauncher("commandlines")
```

PyLauncher will now execute the lines in the file commandlines:

```file
# this is a comment
./yourprogram value1
./yourprogram value2
```

The commands can be complicated as you wish, e.g.:

```file
mkdir output1 && cd output1 && ../yourprogram value1
```

If the commands use a consecutive input parameter, you can use the string PYL_ID which expands to the number of the command. 

```file
./yourprogram -n PYL_ID #1
./yourprogram -n PYL_ID #2
./yourprogram -n PYL_ID #3
./yourprogram -n PYL_ID #4
```

PyLauncher will now distribute each will now run your commandlines, producing final statistics:

```
Launcherjob run completed.

total running time: 222.22

# tasks completed: 160
tasks aborted: 0
max runningtime:  97.95
avg runningtime:  36.59
aggregate  	: 5854.60
speedup    	:  26.35

Host pool of size 40.

Number of tasks executed per node:
max: 11
avg: 4
```

This reports that 160 commands were executed, using 40 cores. Ideally we would expect a 40 times speedup, but because of variations in run time the aggregate running time of all commands was reduced by only 25.

If you want more detailed trace output during the run, add an option:

```job-script
launcher.ClassicLauncher("commandlines",debug="host+job")
```

## Output files

PyLauncher will create a directory "`pylauncher_tmp123456`" where "`123456`" maps to the job number. You can set the name of this directory explicitly:

```job-script
pylauncher.ClassicLauncher("commandlines",workdir="pylauncher_out")
```

However, note that PyLauncher will not allow you to re-use that directory, so you need to delete it in between runs.

You need to take care of the output  of your commandlines explicitly. For instance, your commandlines file could say

```file
mkdir -p myoutput && cd myoutput && ${HOME}/myprogram input1
mkdir -p myoutput && cd myoutput && ${HOME}/myprogram input2
mkdir -p myoutput && cd myoutput && ${HOME}/myprogram input3
...
```

A file "`queuestate`" is generated with a listing of which of your commands were successfully executed, and, in case your job times out, which ones were pending or not scheduled. This can be used to restart your job. See below.

## Parallel runs
### Multi-Threaded

If your program is multi-threaded, you can give each commandline more than one core with:

```job-script
launcher.ClassicLauncher("commandlines",cores=4)
```

This can also be used if your program takes more memory than would normally be assigned to a single core.

If you want each commandline to use all the cores of a node, specify:

```job-script
launcher.ClassicLauncher("commandlines",cores="node")
```

The number of simultaneously running commands is then equal to the number of nodes you requested.

If you have a multi-threaded program and you want to set the number of cores individually for each commandline, use the option `cores="file"` (literally, the word "file" in quotes) and prefix each commandline with the core count:

```file
5,myprogram value1
2,myprogram value2
7,myprogram value3
# et cetera
```

### MPI

If your program is MPI parallel, replace the ClassicLauncher call:

```job-script
launcher.IbrunLauncher("parallellines",cores=3)
```

The parallellines file consists of command-lines without the MPI job starter, which is supplied by PyLauncher:

```file
./parallelprogram 0 10
./parallelprogram 1 10
./parallelprogram 2 10
```

In the launcher invocation, the "debug" parameter causes trace output to be printed during the run. Example:

```
tick 104
Queue:
completed  60 jobs: 0-44 47-48 50-53 56 58 60-61 64 66 68 70 75
aborted 	0 jobs:
queued  	5 jobs: 99-103
running	39 jobs: 45-46 49 54-55 57 59 62-63 65 67 69 71-74 76-98
```

Which states that in the 104'th stage some jobs were completed/queued for running/actually running. 

The  "tick" message is output every half second. This can be changed, for instance to 1/10th of a second, by specifying "delay=.1" in the launcher command. In some cases, for instance if each command is a python invocation that does many "imports", you could increase the delay parameter.

## Sample Job Setup

### Slurm Job Script File on Frontera

```job-script
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH   -p development
#SBATCH   -J pylaunchertest
#SBATCH   -o pylaunchertest.o%j
#SBATCH   -e pylaunchertest.o%j
#SBATCH   â€“ntasks-per-node 1 # this parameter is ignored
#SBATCH   -N 2
#SBATCH   -t 0:40:00
#SBATCH   -A YourProject

module load python3
python3 example_classic_launcher.py

### PyLauncher File

where "example_classic_launcher.py" contains:

```file
import pylauncher
pylauncher.ClassicLauncher("commandlines",debug="host+job")
```

### Command Lines File

and "commandlinefile" contains your parameter sweep.   If your program 

```file
./myparallelprogram arg1 argA
./myparallelprogram arg1 argB
...
```

## Advanced PyLauncher usage

### PyLauncher in an `idev` Session

PyLauncher creates a working directory with a name based on the SLURM job number. PyLauncher will also refuse to reuse a working directory. Together this has implications for running PyLauncher twice in an `idev` session: after the first run, the second run will complain that the working directory already exists. You have to delete it yourself, or explicitly designate a different working directory name in the launcher command:

```file
pylauncher.ClassicLauncher( "mycommandlines",workdir=<unique name>).
```

### Restart File

PyLauncher leaves behind a restart file titled "queuestate" that lists which commandlines were finished, and which ones were under way, or to be scheduled when the launcher job finished. You can use this in case your launcher job is killed for exceeding the time limit. You can then resume:

```file
pylauncher.ResumeClassicLauncher("queuestate",debug="job")
```

The default name "queuestate" can be overridden by giving an explicit name

```file
pylauncher.ClassicLauncher( "commandlines",queuestate="queustate5")
```

### GPU Launcher

PyLauncher can handle programs that need a GPU. Use:

```file
pylauncher.GPULauncher("gpucommandlines")
```


```important
	Set the Slurm parameter `--ntasks-per-node` to the number of GPUs per node.

### Submit launcher

If your commandlines take wildly different amounts of time a launcher job may be wasteful since it will leave cores (and nodes) unused while the longest running commandlines finish. One solution is the `submit launcher' which runs outside of Slurm, and which submits Slurm jobs: For instance, the following command submits jobs to Frontera's small queue, and makes sure that a queue limit of 2 is not exceeded:

```job-script
launcher.SubmitLauncher\
	("commandlines",
 	"-A YourProject -N 1 -n 1 -p small -t 0:15:0", # slurm arguments
 	nactive=2, # queue limit
         )
```

### Debugging PyLauncher Output

Each PyLauncher run stores output to a unique automatically generated subdirectory based on the job ID.

This directory contains three types of files:

* Files with your commandlines as they are executed by the launcher.  Names: exec0 exec1 et cetera.
* Time stamp files that the launcher uses to determine whether commandlines have finished.  Names: expire0 expire1 et cetera.
* Standard out/error files. These can be useful if you observe that some commandlines don't finish or don't give the right result.  Names: out0 out1 et cetera.

### Parameters

Here are some parameters that may sometimes come in handy.

| parameter <option> | description |
--- | --- | 
| `delay=*fraction*`<br>default: `default=.5` | The fraction of a second that PyLauncher waits to start up new jobs, or test for finished ones. If you fire up complicated python jobs, you may want to increase this from the default.
| `workdir=<directory>`<br>default: generated from the SLURM jobid | This is the location of the internal execute/out/test files that PyLauncher generates.
| `queuestate=<filename>`<br>default filename: `queuestate` | This is a file that PyLauncher can use to restart if your jobs aborts, or is killed for exceeding the time limit. If you run multiple simultaneous jobs, you may want to specify this explicitly.
