Today in Class September 5, 2023

## Today in Class 

* Reviewed various solutions for Homework 3. See the "`collatz_discussion.txt`" file in the `sessions` subdirectory in the student repo.
* Began discussion of C++ Objects and Classes.  
* Did Exercises 3 and 6 in class.   Solutions will be uploaded to the repo shortly. 

## Homework 4

**Homework 4 is Programming Project 9 in the Classes and Objects slide deck and is due by Wednesday, September 13, 11:59pm.** 

Place your source files in a subdirectory of your personal repository named `hw4`.  

* You may work in groups of up to three people on this project.  
* **!!! Put each person's name, UTEID, and TACC username at the top of each source code file.!!!** 
* Your code must compile and execute without errors on the ISP machine using the `icpc` compiler.  
* Comment your code.
* Do NOT upload executable files to your personal repo, e.g. "`a.out`".
* It is always better to submit a homework late than to not submit it at all.

## Notes

* Get in the habit of regularly updating your copy of the student repository with the "`git pull`" command.
* Homeworks will be due on Mondays and/or Wednesdays at midnight.  Automatic scripts will collect your homework from the appropriate subdirectory.  It is your responsibility to ensure the instructors and the TA have access to your personal class GitHub repository.
