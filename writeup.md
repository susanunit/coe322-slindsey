## Final Projects

Final Projects account for 30% of your grade and are due on the last day of class, December 9, 2024.

Choose one project out of Chapters 49-55,62 in the [class textbook](https://github.com/TACC/coe322fall2024/blob/main/EijkhoutIntroSciProgramming-book.pdf). 
* Ch 49. Infectious Disease Simulation
* Ch 50. Google PageRank
* Ch 51. Redistricting
* Ch 52. Amazon Delivery Truck Scheduling
* Ch 53. High Performance Linear Algebra
* Ch 54. The Great Garbage Patch
* Ch 55. Graph Algorithms
* Ch 62. Climate Change


The Infectious Disease Simulation project is a single-person project.  You may work in teams up to three on the other four projects.  **We will be expecting far more rigorous and extensive write-ups and analysis from groups of three people**.

Your project directory in your private repository will contain:
* source code and instructions on how to compile a single executable (if necessary)
* a write-up in PDF format

## Write-ups 

See Chapter 44. "Style Guide for Project Submissions" in the [class textbook](https://github.com/TACC/coe322fall2024/blob/main/EijkhoutIntroSciProgramming-book.pdf). 

Your project is a simulation of a real-world scenario, each with variable model parameters.  Once your code is finished, you'll make multiple runs, varying the appropriate parameters and generating data.  Your writeup will summarize your conclusions derived from that data.  Your writeup is not primarily about your code, but you do need to explain how your code solves your problem. For this, you can both describe your algorithms in general terms, and give code snippets that show the essential part.

### Some Tips

* Run your simulations with appropriately-sized datasets.  For example, the infectious disease simulation should be run with populations in the thousands and more.  A population of 10 is not acceptable.  
* You are encouraged to discuss your code by including relevant snippets, not full listings. Any code in your writeup should be rendered in a monospaced font. 
* Screenshots of code or data are **not acceptable**.
* Graphs are good.  Use whatever tool you feel comfortable with, e.g. Matlab, Excel or `gnuplot`.
