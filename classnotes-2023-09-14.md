See also the examples from today's session in the `cmakedemo` subdirectory of the student repo's [`sessions`](https://github.com/TACC/coe322fall2023/tree/main/sessions) subdirectory..
* Started reviewing the C++ [Class Inheritance](https://github.com/TACC/coe322fall2023/blob/main/lectures/Class%20inheritance.pdf) slide deck and did Exercise 1 in class. The solution is posted in 
* Keep up with the corresponding reading in the class textbook: [Chapter 9. Classes and objects](https://github.com/TACC/coe322fall2023/blob/main/EijkhoutIntroSciProgramming-book.pdf).  Download and view the book on your local computer.

**Homework 4 deadline is extended to Sunday, September 17th, 11:59pm.**
**Homework 4 is Programming Project 9 in the Classes and Objects slide deck.** 

Place your source files in a subdirectory of your personal repository named `hw4`.  

* You may work in groups of up to three people on this project.  
* **!!! Put each person's name, UTEID, and TACC username at the top of each source code file.!!!** 
* Your code must compile and execute without errors on the ISP machine using the `icpc` compiler.  
* Comment your code.
* Do NOT upload executable files to your personal repo, e.g. "`a.out`".
* It is always better to submit a homework late than to not submit it at all.

## Homework 5

**Homework 5 is Programming Project 10 in the Classes and Objects slide deck and is due by Wednesday, September 20, 11:59pm.** 

This program builds upon HW4, the Prime Generator assignment.

Place your source files in a subdirectory of your personal repository named `hw5`.  

**Beginning with this homework assignment, incorporate CMake instructions into your homework directory, such that `make build` will successfully compile and build your single-source executable. **

## Notes

* Regularly update your copy of the student repository with the "`git pull`" command.
* Homeworks will be due on Mondays and/or Wednesdays at midnight.  Automatic scripts will collect your homework from the appropriate subdirectory.  It is your responsibility to ensure the instructors and the TA have access to your personal class GitHub repository.
