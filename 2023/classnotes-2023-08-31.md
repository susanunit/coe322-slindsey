Today in Class August 31, 2023

Today in class we:

* Began class demonstrating how to set up and collaborate on a git repository.  See the updated [/Setting up a git repository](https://github.com/TACC/coe322fall2023/blob/main/tutorials/Setting%20up%20a%20git%20repository.pdf) document. 
* Continued the review of [Basic C++ topics](https://github.com/TACC/coe322fall2023/blob/main/lectures/C%2B%2B%20intro%20catchup.pdf).
.  
* Did Exercises 4 and 5 from this slide deck in class.  See the solutions in [the `sessions` subdirectory](https://github.com/TACC/coe322fall2023/tree/main/sessions) of the student repo.

We recognize that many of you had difficulties setting up and synchronizing your github repositories.  Please help each other out in the general Slack channel.

## Homework 3

Homework 3 is due by Monday, September 4, 11:59pm.  

**Homework 3 is Exercises 3 and 6 in the Basic C++ Topics slide deck.**

Place both source files in a subdirectory of your personal repository named `hw3`.

* Put your name, UTEID, and TACC username at the top of each source code file. 
* Both programs must compile and execute without errors on the ISP machine using the `icpc` compiler.  
* Comment your code.

This is a single-person homework. You may not work in groups.  Each student must submit their own source code.
