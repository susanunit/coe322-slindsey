This Week in Class October 5, 2023

## This Week in Class 

* On Thursday, the professor introduced [Smart Pointers](https://github.com/TACC/coe322fall2023/blob/main/lectures/Smart%20Pointers.pdf).  We began Exercise 1 from this slide deck in class.   
* Keep up with the corresponding reading, Chapter 16. Pointers, in the [class textbook](https://github.com/TACC/coe322fall2023/blob/main/EijkhoutIntroSciProgramming-book.pdf).  

## Homework 8

**Homework 8 is a do-over of Homework 5 and is due by Monday, October 9th, 11:59pm**

While many of your HW5 solutions correctly outputed the number pairs, the method by which you obtained the solution was not what was wanted.  Use your `PrimeGenerator` object developed in HW4, not `for`-loops, to accomplish the computations.  The professor demonstrated various what-not-to-do's for this exercise in Thursday's lecture.

## Homework 9 

**Homework 8 is Exercise 1 in the Shared Pointers slide deck and is due Wednesday, October 11th 11:59pm.**  

See the `dynrect.cpp` code in the [skeletons](https://github.com/TACC/coe322fall2023/tree/main/skeletons) subdirectory of the class repository.  You do not need the advanced topics in the Shared Pointer slides to accomplish this homework.  


## General Homework Instructions

* **Incorporate a "`CMakeLists.txt`" file in your homework directory, so that `cmake`/`make` commands (as demonstrated in class) will compile and build your code.**
* Your code must compile and execute without errors on the ISP machine using the `icpc` compiler.  
* Comment your code.
* Do NOT upload executable files to your personal repo, e.g. "`a.out`".
* It is always better to submit a homework late than to not submit it at all.

### Teamwork

* We encourage you to communicate and collaborate with your fellow students using the Slack channel "#2023-coe-general".  You may work in teams of up to three people.  If you are working in a team:
* Include each team member's name and EID at the top of each source code file.
* If your team would like a private Slack channel, contact the instructors.

## Notes

* **VSCode users**: See the [instructions for installing external libraries](https://github.com/TACC/coe322fall2023/blob/main/tutorials/VSCode%20and%20libraries.pdf).
* **WSL users**: Always work from within the `bash` shell. Try typing `make` or `cmake`, if those are "unknown command"s, then install with `apt install`.
* Be sure to regularly update your copy of the class repository with the "`git pull`" command.
* Homework will be due on Mondays and/or Wednesdays at midnight.  Automatic scripts will collect your homework from the appropriate subdirectory.  It is your responsibility to ensure the instructors and the TA have access to your personal class GitHub repository.
